## Character Limit

**Aim for: 50-150 characters**

- ✅ Sweet, readable length
- ✅ Captures essence quickly
- ✅ Works well in UI and AI prompts

## Quick Test

Ask yourself:

1. **Is it specific?** (Not "friendly" but "greets everyone at the door")
2. **Is it unique?** (Not already covered by other fields)
3. **Is it endearing?** (Would it make someone smile?)
4. **Is it true?** (Based on actual observed behavior)

If yes to all 4 → Perfect quirk! ✨
