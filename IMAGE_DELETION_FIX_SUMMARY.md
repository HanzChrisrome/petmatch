# Image Deletion Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Null Check Error on \_petId** ✅

**Problem:** When adding a new pet, `_petId` was null, causing the app to crash with "Null check operator used on a null value"

**Solution:**

- Added UUID import to `add_pet_screen.dart`
- Generate a new UUID in `initState()` for new pets
- Use existing pet ID for editing mode

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();

  if (widget.petToEdit != null) {
    _prefillFormData();
  } else {
    // Generate new UUID for new pet
    _petId = const Uuid().v4();
  }
}
```

### 2. **Image Not Showing (Using Filenames Instead of Full URLs)** ✅

**Problem:** The code was passing `pet.imageUrls` (filenames) instead of `pet.fullImageUrls` (complete Supabase URLs)

**Solution:** Changed line 105 in `add_pet_screen.dart`:

```dart
// Before: _existingImageUrls = List.from(pet.imageUrls); // ❌ Just filenames
// After:
_existingImageUrls = List.from(pet.fullImageUrls); // ✅ Full URLs
```

### 3. **Image Deletion Not Working** ✅

**Problem:**

- Storage path extraction was incorrect
- Database deletion was commented out
- No UI feedback during deletion

**Solution:**

#### In `pet_repository.dart`:

- Fixed `deletePetImage()` to properly extract storage path from URL
- Handles both full URLs and plain filenames
- Uncommented database record deletion
- Added comprehensive logging

```dart
// Extract storage path correctly
String storagePath;
if (imageUrl.contains('/pets/')) {
  storagePath = imageUrl.split('/pets/').last; // petId/filename.png
} else {
  storagePath = '$petId/$imageUrl';
}

// Delete from storage
await bucket.remove([storagePath]);

// Delete from database
await _supabase
    .from('pets_images')
    .delete()
    .eq('pet_id', petId)
    .eq('image_path', filename);
```

#### In `pet_provider.dart`:

- Returns deleted filename for tracking
- Refreshes pet list after deletion

#### In `basic_info_step.dart`:

- Added loading indicator
- Shows success/error messages
- Updates local UI state immediately

## How to Test

### Test 1: Add New Pet (Verify petId Fix)

1. ✅ Open Pet Management page
2. ✅ Click "Add Pet" button
3. ✅ Verify no crash occurs
4. ✅ Add pet images and fill out form
5. ✅ Save pet successfully

### Test 2: Edit Existing Pet (Verify Image Display)

1. ✅ Open Pet Management page
2. ✅ Click Edit on any pet with images
3. ✅ Verify existing images display with blue "saved" badges
4. ✅ Verify images are NOT showing as broken/placeholder

### Test 3: Delete Image from Edit Screen

1. ✅ Edit a pet with multiple images
2. ✅ Click red X button on any image
3. ✅ Confirm deletion in dialog
4. ✅ Verify "Deleting image..." message appears
5. ✅ Verify image disappears from gallery
6. ✅ Verify "Image deleted successfully" green message
7. ✅ Check Supabase Storage bucket - image should be deleted
8. ✅ Check `pets_images` table - record should be deleted

### Test 4: Verify Supabase Policies

Make sure you have the correct RLS policy on your `pets` storage bucket:

```sql
-- Policy for DELETE operations
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own pet images"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'pets' AND
  auth.uid() IN (
    SELECT owner_id FROM public.pets
    WHERE pet_id = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  )
);
```

## Expected Console Output (During Image Deletion)

```
🗑️ Deleting image for pet ID: abc-123-def, Image URL: https://xyz.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/pets/abc-123-def/Luna-1.png
🗑️ Attempting to delete image...
Pet ID: abc-123-def
Image URL: https://xyz.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/pets/abc-123-def/Luna-1.png
📍 Extracted storage path: abc-123-def/Luna-1.png
📂 Files in folder abc-123-def: [Luna-thumbnail.png, Luna-1.png, Luna-2.png]
✅ Deleted from storage: abc-123-def/Luna-1.png
Delete result: [...]
✅ Deleted database record for: Luna-1.png
📤 Fetching first batch of pets...
✅ Fetched X pets (page 1)
✅ Image deleted: Luna-1.png
```

## Troubleshooting

### If deletion still doesn't work:

1. **Check Supabase Policies**

   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage → Policies
   - Ensure DELETE policy exists for `pets` bucket
   - Test policy with SQL query

2. **Check Console Logs**

   - Look for error messages in console
   - Verify the storage path is correct
   - Check if files are listed correctly

3. **Check Authentication**

   - Ensure user is logged in
   - Verify `auth.uid()` matches pet owner_id

4. **Manual Test in Supabase**

   ```sql
   -- Check if image exists in database
   SELECT * FROM pets_images WHERE pet_id = 'your-pet-id';

   -- Check storage files
   -- Go to Storage → pets bucket → Navigate to pet folder
   ```

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `add_pet_screen.dart` - Fixed petId initialization, fixed image URLs
2. ✅ `pet_repository.dart` - Fixed deletePetImage, uncommented DB deletion
3. ✅ `pet_provider.dart` - Added refresh after deletion
4. ✅ `basic_info_step.dart` - Enhanced UI feedback, removed unused import

## Next Steps

1. Hot reload/restart the app
2. Test adding a new pet (should not crash)
3. Test editing an existing pet (images should show)
4. Test deleting an image (should work with feedback)
5. Verify in Supabase that files and records are actually deleted
